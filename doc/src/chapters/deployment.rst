System Daemon
-------------

    sudo bash install.bat USERNAME

For permanent installation add the systemd settings file.  A script has been provided to
setup the systemd file.  It needs to be run as sudo because it updates the /etc/systemd/system directory.
Pass in the username that you want to run the index as.  It will use the current working directory
so make sure you are in the project's root directory.  The following assumes the -b flag was used at least once.

.. code-block::

    sudo bash install.bat USERNAME # setup systemd config file
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload # to restart systemd
    sudo systemctl start trivia # to start trivia index
    sudo journalctl -u trivia # to view results
