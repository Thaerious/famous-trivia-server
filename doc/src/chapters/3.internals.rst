Overview
=================

The program entry point is `src/index/index.js`_.
This is where the Express webserver is setup and started.
It starts the following modules and services:

* Session manager.
* Game manager service.
* CORS settings.
* Embedded JavaScript (ejs) template engine.
* Just-In-Time (JIT) javascript browserify/babel.
* The Websocket to listen for new connections.

**Settings**

* Values that are not expected to change are found in: `src/constants.js`_.
* Settings that may change are found in: `src/config.js`_.

===============
Root HTML Pages
===============
There are 6 single page applications which serve as entry points.
These are found in the '/views/pages' directory.
They are .ejs pages which compile into .html pages.
This permits the automatic injection of Nidget dependencies.

* contestant_join.ejs : the contestant enters their name to join a game.
* editor.ejs : the host edit's a game.
* host.ejs : the host's main menu where they can manage and launch games.
* launch_console.ejs : host's submenu to manage a launched game.
* contestant_portal.ejs : the contestant's game view (where they actually play).
* host_portal.ejs : the host's game view (where they actually play).

=====================
Game Manager Endpoint
=====================
The GameManagerEndpoint is the main api starting point for any client interacting with the index.
The endpoint url is "HOSTNAME/game-manager-service".  The format, exampled below, consists of
a required 'action' field.  Other required fields depend on the contents of the action field.  The
client has a corresponding  GameManagerService class which calls the endpoint actions.

All actions return a json object with the result field set to 'success', 'rejected', or 'error'.
If the result if 'error' or 'rejected' there will also be a 'reason' field.
The following actions are supported:

launch
------
Launch a new game with the user as host.
The model is result from GameDescriptionModel#get().
This method will verify the user's google credentials.
The 'game-hash' returned is used to connect to the game with
future API calls.
A user can only host one game at a time.::

  {
    'action' : 'launch',
    'model'  : game-description-model,
    'token'  : google-auth-token
  }

returns::

    res.json({
        result : "success",
        hash   : game-hash
    }

terminate
---------
Stop a currently running game.
This method will verify the user's google credentials.::

    {
        action : "terminate",
        token  : google-auth-token
    }

returns::

    res.json({
        result : "success"
    }

join-game
---------
Create a contestant with the given name.
The contestant will be associated with the current session.
Each session can only have one contestant.
The host can not also be a contestant.::

    {
        'action'    : "join-game",
        'game-hash' : game-hash,
        'name'      : string
    }

returns::

    {
        result : 'success'
    }

has-game
--------
Determine if a user is currently hosting a game.::

  {
    'action' : 'has-game',
    'token'  : google-auth-token
  }

returns::

    {
        result : 'success',
        hash   : game-hash,
    }

get-game-hash
-------------
Determine if the current session has been associated with a game (see join-game).::

    {
        'action'    : "get-game-hash"
        'game-hash' : game-hash
    }

returns::

    {
        result : 'success',
        hash   : game-hash,
    }

==================
Websocket Commands
==================

Connection.parseMessage is the first method to intercept a command.
Second is Game.onInput.
Lastly, each state in Game may handle the input object.

All commands are in JSON format, with an 'action', 'players', and 'data' field.
The player field is set by the Connection class object and will overwrite any
provided by the client.  This will have the registered player name.  In the case
of the host it will be '@HOST'.  Data sub-fields are determined by the action listed below.::

    {
        action : "string",
        player : "string",
        data   : {}
    }

Accepted actions:

* request_model
* next_round
* prev_round
* start
* continue
* back
* accept
* reject
* expire
* buzz
* update_index {index}
* update_bet {bet}
* select {col, row}
* set_score {name, score}

======================
Game Description Model
======================
The game description model (src/client/GameDescriptionModel.js) stores the questions for
a trivia game.  GameDescriptionModel#get() returns the json version of the model.  The
GameDescriptionModel class is just a helper class to manipulate the json.  The root object
(shown below) contains the game name and an array of rounds.  There are currently two flavours
of rounds, with the option to easily add more.

json root::

    {
        name : string,
        rounds : [{}, ..., {}]
    }

Jeopardy style round::

    {
        type : "categorical",
        column : [
            {
                category : string,
                font-size : string,
                cell : [
                    {
                        value : number,
                        type : "text",
                        q : string,
                        a : string
                    }
                ] x 5
            },
        ] x 6
    }

Multiple choice round::

    {
        type : "multiple_choice",
        bonus : number,
        question : string,
        answers : [
            string_1, ..., string_6
        ],
        values : [
            boolean_1, ..., boolean_6
        ]
    }
